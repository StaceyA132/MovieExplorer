# MovieExplorer
I developed a Movie Explorer app using Swift and UIKit in Xcode that allows users to browse a collection of movies retrieved from a third-party API. I implemented network requests using URLSession to fetch and decode JSON data into Swift models with Codable. The app displays movies in a scrollable UICollectionView, and when a movie is selected, it navigates to a detailed view showing the description, rating, and other information. I also added a feature that lets users favorite movies, with favorites saved locally using UserDefaults for quick access. The app follows the MVC architecture and uses Auto Layout to ensure a responsive and clean user interface across various iOS devices.
